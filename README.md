## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

Project Overview:
In this repository, I've developed a Real-Time Software Defined Radio (SDR) system capable of handling Mono/Stereo FM and RDS signals. This project was undertaken as part of the Computer Systems Integration Project at McMaster University, showcasing my capabilities in managing real-time signal processing challenges within constrained environments.

Project Description:
The SDR system is designed to:
- Receive and process FM broadcast signals in both mono and stereo formats.
- Decode and present Radio Data System (RDS) information transmitted alongside standard FM broadcasts.
- Operate efficiently under custom sample rates and specific signal processing constraints unique to our project group.

Technical Highlights:
- Language & Tools: Primarily developed in C/C++.
- Signal Processing: Utilizes custom digital signal processing algorithms for FM demodulation and RDS decoding.
- Optimization: Focuses on enhancing performance for real-time execution within limited computing environments.

Project Outcome:
Successfully implementing this project demonstrated my proficiency in navigating digital signal processing concepts and applying them to real-world scenarios. It solidified my understanding of software-defined radio technologies in constrained computational environments.
